NAME
    List::Group - Group a list of data structures to your specifications.

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Group qw[group];
      my @list  = qw[cat dog cow rat];
      my @group = group @list, cols => 2;

      foreach my $row ( @group ) {
        print "@{$row}\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    A simple module that currently allows you to group a list by columns or
    rows.

  Functions
    "group" *listref*, *args*
              my @table = group \@list, cols => 2;

            This function returns a list-of-lists containing the elements of
            *listref* passed as the first argument. The remaining arguments
            detail how to group the elements. Available groupings are
            "cols", and "rows". Each of these groupings accept a single
            digit as a value, the number of "cols" or "rows" to create.

            The following is what @table would look like from the previous
            example.

              my @list  = qw[cat dog mouse rat];
              my @table = group \@list, cols => 2;

              print Dumper \@table;
              __END__

              $VAR1 = [
                [ 'cat', 'dog' ],
                [ 'mouse', 'rat' ]
              ];
